This is a quick demo for an elm-doc-builder-gem I'm writing. 
Eventually I'll set that one up in an open repo as well.

I'm in the process of wiring it but, eventually all the logic will reside on json files in the `_data` directory. 

I'm thinking of re-writing the gem so it works best for jekyll using the jekyll theme pattern. 

TODO:

[_] use gem locally and jekyll-assets to build locally. 
[_] make sure json schema is up to date.
